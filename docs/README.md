## Static Site Generator

This is the working repo for static site generation via Jekyll. Initially, this will serve as the landing page on the weteachblockchain.org domain, but may be expanded in the future. 


# Goals

## Short Term

1. Replace weteachblockchain.org landing page per new mockups 

2. Create sub-pages for course landing pages

## Long Term

1. Integrate Courses Structure 

2. Integrate Calendar Page 



# To-Do

1. New Landing Page 'includes' items

	a. Nav 

	b. Header Section w/ Banner Image

	c. Left / Right Image Sections w/ Text

	d. Call-to-Action Section

	e. Footer

	f. Footer image overlay

2. Test Pretty-Links and Directory Sub-structures



# Issues

1. How to handle search on static site (pre-filled JS map?)

2. CSS Framework (Bootstrap, GH Primer, Foundation, or Inuit)
